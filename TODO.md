# wiz6 TODO

Stable-ID task list for cross-session tracking. Future sessions: read this on start; new items go in **Open** with the next free ID; closed items get **deleted** (git log preserves history). Never reuse IDs.

Format:

```
- #NNN [open|blocked] — Title
  - Notes / dependencies / refs
```

`open` = ready to work, `blocked` = waiting on another ID. There is no `done` status — finished items are removed.

Companion file: [`INBOX.md`](INBOX.md) — Nate's freeform jot pad. Claude processes it into TODO entries (single batch commit per session).

Next free ID: **#018**

## Open

- #004 [open] — PIC Stage B: pixel rendering + monster sprite integration
  - In-flight plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-22-pic-stage-b-pixel-rendering.md` (6/57 boxes checked).
  - Decoder spec is complete; need descriptor parsing rewrite, EGA cell rendering, viewer wiring.

- #005 [open] — Viewer redesign Stage 2c
  - Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-22-viewer-redesign-stage-2c.md` (0/50).
  - Not started.

- #006 [open] — Viewer redesign Stage 2d (monster power tools)
  - Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-22-viewer-redesign-stage-2d.md` (0/44).
  - Compare mode (`/monsters/compare`), family-grouped index, copy-bytes/JSON header buttons.
  - `.pic` monster sprites are still blocked on prior stage; cross-references with #004.

- #009 [open] — Savegame + Roster management strategy for the web port (design done, implementation pending)
  - **Design settled**: see [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-savegame-strategy.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-savegame-strategy.md).
  - **TL;DR**: three persistence layers (per-visitor roster + 6 save slots + curated static gallery). Our own zod schemas (`CharacterSchema`, `PartyMemberSchema`, `SaveSchema`, `RosterSchema`) in `@wiz6/data`. localStorage primary, manual download/upload for portability. RNG seed advisory. DOS `SAVEGAME.DBS` interop deferred to a bridge module (needs separate RE pass). Saves are character snapshots with optional roster back-references; saves remain loadable without the roster. Curated gallery (static `/public/gallery/characters.json`) seeds new visitors' rosters on first visit. Savegame + roster editors in the data explorer deferred.
  - **Implementation phases** (none on the critical path yet): schemas → encoder/decoder → save+roster storage → gallery seed → roster page → saves page. Phase 7 (DOS interop) + Phase 8 (editors) wait until the core ships.

## Open questions (lower priority; investigation tasks, not features)

- #Q-B — wbase.ovr audio-config struct (partial)
  - 5 bytes copied to `0x3590..0x3594` at file `0x1488`. Identify option labels ("PC Speaker / AdLib / Tandy / Silent") and the device-selection contract. **Partially answered by #Q-L pass (2026-05-24)**: `*0x1756` is the device byte and `*0x3590` is the audio-mode/volume class. Config is NOT auto-detected — it's set by wbase from a static struct. Still need to identify the exact label↔value mapping in the menu UI.

- #Q-D — Fast-mode trigger (`*0x1760 & 2`)
  - Which gameplay states or sounds set the fast bit? Title clang uses slow.

- #Q-E — Apply audio-driver rename fixes to Ghidra project
  - The 2026-05-24 AdLib deep-dive (`docs/re/findings/wroot-adlib-driver.json`) produced 9 rename proposals for the audio driver region of wroot.exe. Key change: the misnamed `audio_adlib_init_voice@0x11962` (which is actually a 3-byte PIC EOI IRET stub) needs to be dropped; the real AdLib init is at image `0x11765` and should be named `adlib_chip_init_voice0`. Other proposals cover `adlib_write_register@0x11892`, the two delay helpers, the volume-LUT builder at `FUN_1000_17FE`, etc.
  - Method to close: update `tools/ghidra/scripts/apply_audio_names.py` (or write a new apply script) to merge the rename_proposals from the findings file. Also update `docs/re/snd-format.md` to fix the now-known-wrong "256-byte fixed LUT" claim (the LUT is runtime-rebuilt per call by `FUN_1000_17FE`).

- #Q-J — Decode `rate_or_vol` semantics in the sound-table
  - The sound-table snapshot in `@wiz6/data/sound-table.ts` exposes per-slot `rate_or_vol` values (e.g. slot 4 = 0x49, slot 7 = 0x34, slot 13 = 0x3C). The field is labelled "volume index" in the deep-dive findings but we haven't decoded the semantics — is the high nibble rate, low nibble volume? Is it scaled by music-mode at `*0x3590`? Affects in-game playback fidelity, not the intro (the intro currently uses `duration` for rate adjustment which is sufficient for SOUND04/05/06/07/13).
  - Method to close: decompile `audio_play_sound` at wroot image 0x10AAA and trace how rate_or_vol gets consumed. Or empirically vary playback rate while listening in DOSBox-X and our viewer.

- #Q-L — AdLib FM channel layered with PCM during intro (and likely throughout)
  - Found 2026-05-24: the DOSBox-X save state Mixer blob shows **"Adlib"** as the first channel and **"DBOPL"** (DOSBox-X's OPL3 FM emulator) state attached. The sirtech-splash moment isn't just SOUND04.SND — it's SOUND04 + an AdLib FM track playing in parallel. User's "layered chaos" perception of sirtech is real and structural.
  - Our viewer only plays PCM .snd files. We're missing the entire AdLib music + effects channel for the intro AND probably for in-game (dungeon footsteps, combat impacts, etc.).
  - Method to close: (a) RE the AdLib music/effects driver in wroot (#Q-E hints at this — `audio_adlib_init_voice` is mis-named, real driver elsewhere; possibly `FUN_1000_17fe`). (b) Identify where the AdLib register writes originate, what data format they read. (c) Either ship a JS OPL3 emulator (heavy) OR pre-render the AdLib tracks to PCM at extract time and layer them.
  - Doesn't block any current work but is a substantial fidelity gap for the audio port. Likely the right time to tackle is after the rest of the intro/UI polish lands.

- #Q-K — Runtime pitch modulation for context-dependent sounds
  - User observation (2026-05-24): the same .snd file (e.g. the death-groan sound effect) plays at different pitches depending on character context — sex of the dying character, possibly other state. Our static per-slot rate snapshot (`@wiz6/data/sound-table.ts`) captures only the BASELINE rate; the engine clearly modulates pitch at call time for some events.
  - Likely source: an additional parameter passed into `audio_play_by_id(N, duration_param, ?, flags_param)` at the call site. Or a runtime modifier byte in the sound-table flags field that the caller mutates before invocation.
  - Method to close: identify a deterministic in-game event with pitch variation (death groan via cliff-fall TPK is a good candidate per user), capture saves immediately before AND after the event in DOSBox-X, diff the sound-table memory + relevant character fields. Or decompile the specific call site (e.g. wmaze's TPK handler) to see what it passes.
  - Doesn't block any current work — intro/credits sounds are deterministic. Relevant when we get to dungeon/combat audio.
