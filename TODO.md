# wiz6 TODO

Stable-ID task list for cross-session tracking. Future sessions: read this on start; new items go in **Open** with the next free ID; closed items get **deleted** (git log preserves history). Never reuse IDs.

Format:

```
- #NNN [open|blocked] — Title
  - Notes / dependencies / refs
```

`open` = ready to work, `blocked` = waiting on another ID. There is no `done` status — finished items are removed.

Companion file: [`INBOX.md`](INBOX.md) — Nate's freeform jot pad. Claude processes it into TODO entries (single batch commit per session).

Next free ID: **#007**

## Open

- #002 [open] — Per-scene palette switching
  - Ship one empirical EGA palette + 7 overrides. Other scenes (spaceship is the canonical example: blue-green) show off-colors.
  - Goal: absolute fidelity to the source app — every scene matches DOSBox-X output byte-for-byte.
  - Needs: a way to identify which palette index applies per scene (probably encoded in screen metadata or a per-screen field in the loader path).
  - Refs: palette-related commits `19df14d` ("revert overzealous index 6/14 overrides"), `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-stage-1d-palette-design.md`.

- #003 [open] — Naming passes for combat/character/NPC/treasure overlays
  - Still on `FUN_XXXX` auto-names: `wmele.ovr`, `wpcmk.ovr`, `wpcvw.ovr`, `wmnpc.ovr`, `wtrea.ovr`.
  - Schedule when simulation work on those subsystems starts.
  - Pattern reference: `docs/re/findings/wmaze-naming-pass.json`, `docs/re/findings/wbase-main-menu.json`.

- #004 [open] — PIC Stage B: pixel rendering + monster sprite integration
  - In-flight plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-22-pic-stage-b-pixel-rendering.md` (6/57 boxes checked).
  - Decoder spec is complete; need descriptor parsing rewrite, EGA cell rendering, viewer wiring.

- #005 [open] — Viewer redesign Stage 2c
  - Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-22-viewer-redesign-stage-2c.md` (0/50).
  - Not started.

- #006 [open] — Viewer redesign Stage 2d (monster power tools)
  - Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-22-viewer-redesign-stage-2d.md` (0/44).
  - Compare mode (`/monsters/compare`), family-grouped index, copy-bytes/JSON header buttons.
  - `.pic` monster sprites are still blocked on prior stage; cross-references with #004.

## Open questions (lower priority; investigation tasks, not features)

- #Q-A — Variable-port audio hardware (`*0x1756 ≥ 2` selector)
  - Engine uses runtime-patched port from `[cs:0x175B]`. Tandy PSG / SB DSP / other? `docs/re/snd-format.md` §"Open questions" #1.

- #Q-B — wbase.ovr audio-config struct
  - 5 bytes copied to `0x3590..0x3594` at file `0x1488`. Identify option labels ("PC Speaker / AdLib / Tandy / Silent") and the device-selection contract.

- #Q-C — Per-sound rate populator
  - Runtime sound table at DGROUP `0x3344` (12-byte entries) has `duration` / `rate_or_vol` / `flags`. Find the boot-time populator so we can play each sound at its native rate instead of the global default.

- #Q-D — Fast-mode trigger (`*0x1760 & 2`)
  - Which gameplay states or sounds set the fast bit? Title clang uses slow.

- #Q-E — Bogus `audio_adlib_init_voice` rename at image `0x11962`
  - Listed in findings file but the bytes there are just an EOI/IRET stub. Real AdLib init must be elsewhere — possibly `FUN_1000_17fe`. Not yet traced.
